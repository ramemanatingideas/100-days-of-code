# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: June 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learnt Natural Language Processing and Implemented the Bag of Words Model.

**Thoughts:** Learnt the concept behind the idea of NLP ,did a classification on the reviews of customers based on a restaurant dataset.Implemented using the Bag of Words model. Feeling Happy and satisfied to have spent a good amount of time on learning the new concept in ML and implementing on the way . Paved way as a little eye opener. Hoping to continue the trend. 

**Link to work:** N/A (not uploaded to github currently)

### Day 2: June 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Did predictive analysis of abalone data set from UCI ML repsository on the determiing the age of the abalone species found near the sea shores of tasmania .

**Thoughts:** Applied regression model on the the dataset . Fized the issue of importing the dataset to the matrix of features . Still having some problem on plotting the ppints in the scatter plot . Overall was a satisfactory day since it was fun playing with it . Need to improve more on analysis . Learnt aboit the concpwt of correlation and its applocation in predictive analysis.

**Link to work:** N/A (not uploaded to github currently)

### Day 3: June 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**:Implemented the Graph Colouring algorithm in C++ .

**Thoughts:** Implemented the Graph Coloring method . A bit straight forward but satsifactory . Kept the streak on. Implemented in C++ to save more time nothing else.

### Day 4: June 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**:Did Predictive Analysis on Iris Dataset from UCI ML repository.

**Thoughts:** Analysed the data from the repository . Applied multinomial classification using K-Nearest-Neighbours based on the validation of the model performance using the k-folds method . Got a good hands on approach on a small level data and on useful plots to understand the relation between the variables.
